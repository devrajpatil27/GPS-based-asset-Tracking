# GPS-Based Vehicle Tracking using ARM Cortex M LPC1768

## Introduction

This project addresses the increasing demand for advanced and secure solutions in vehicle monitoring and management. The system's primary focus is on integrating cutting-edge features, including password-based entry, distance monitoring, geo-fencing, and secure door opening through the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol.

## Features

### 1. Real-time GPS Tracking
Utilizing GPS technology, the system provides accurate real-time tracking of vehicle locations. This feature lays the foundation for enhanced security measures and comprehensive monitoring.

### 2. Password-Based Entry
The implementation of a password-based entry system ensures authorized access to the vehicle. Unauthorized attempts trigger a buzzer mechanism, enhancing security and discouraging unauthorized access.

### 3. Distance Monitoring
Real-time distance monitoring adds dynamic tracking capabilities to the system. This feature allows for continuous tracking of the vehicle's movement, providing valuable insights into its usage patterns.

### 4. Geo-fencing
The system incorporates geo-fencing capabilities, allowing users to define virtual boundaries. Notifications are triggered when the vehicle enters or exits these predefined geographical zones, providing an additional layer of security and monitoring.

### 5. Secure Door Opening via CAN Protocol
Integration of the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol introduces a secure door opening mechanism. Only authorized users with the correct password can access the vehicle, enhancing overall security.
